Testing GIT

I'm trying to figure out if GIT is the better choice for my source code. the problem with GIt is that there are extra steps needed for updating the master branch and I just don't want to have to do those steps. Subversion has been nice to me because I can make changes and commit them and that's it! The source code in subversion is updated and I'm set. With GIT, I'll have to remember that committing/updating/whatever to the local repository does not imediately provide a backup for my sources. But I really like being able to just commit to the remote server to have my code backed up imediately.
